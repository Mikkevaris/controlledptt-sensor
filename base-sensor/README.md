# BaseSensor

A C# project that serves as a base class for all C# programs that communicate with hardware sensors. Reference to DLL generated by this project must be included in all of these C# programs in order to visualize temperature data. Instructions how to include the reference is found in every sensor's "Running C# program" section.
