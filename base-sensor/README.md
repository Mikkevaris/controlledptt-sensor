# BaseSensor

A C# project that serves as a base class for all C# programs that communicate with hardware sensors. Reference to DLL generated by this project must be included in all of these C# programs in order to visualize temperature data. Instructions to include the reference can be found in the “Running C# Program” section of each sensor.
